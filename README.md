# Weather PWA
This site is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display the current weather for a given city. It also uses the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get the user's location and display the weather for that location.
